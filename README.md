# Kirisame Magic Shop

This repo contains the source code of the site [Kirisame Magic
Shop](https://kirisamemagicshop.github.io/), which currently serves as a
mirror and blog site for (mainly PLT and functional programming related)
technical articles.

## Submitting Articles

New articles should be added to `content/articles/<title-in-kebab-case>.md`.
They should contain a frontmatter like

```
+++
title = 'Post Title'
author = 'Your Name'
date = 2024-09-01T20:06:17+08:00 # Datetime in TOML format
+++
```

which can be generated with `hugo new content <path-to-content-md>`.

The body is in markdown format, supporting KaTeX inline and block math.
